id: Child Born Outside of Marriage
question: Children Born Outside of Marriage
subquestion: |
  Missouri law automatically assumes that the husband is the father of the child unless a separate case is filed establishing paternity of the biological father and non-paternity of the husband, even if the biological father is the one on the birth certificate.  It would be in your best interest to find an attorney.

id: Children Born Before Marriage
question: Children Born Before Marriage
subquestion: |
  Sometimes when a child is born to two people before they get married, the court will require a separate case to establish paternity (even if everybody agrees).  However, most courts will move forward with just the divorce, assuming that paternity is acknowledged through the marriage.  For now, we'll move forward with the understanding that the paternity has been acknowledged.  However, a judge may direct you to file something else or speak to an attorney.
