id: personal_jurisdiction_warning
question: No personal jurisdiction
subquestion: |
  If your spouse does not live in Missouri currently, and you did not live together in Missouri, then the court will not have personal jurisdiction over your spouse.  This means the court can not make your spouse pay maintenance or child support.  
  
  You may want to consider filing for divorce in the state where your spouse lives.

event: jurisdiction_kickout
question: No jurisdiction
subquestion: |
  Missouri law requires that at least one party in the divorce live in Missouri for at least 90 days before filing divorce.  Since neither you nor your spouse has lived in Missouri for 90 days, this tool is not appropriate for you.

      val("minor_children") === true || val("minor_children") === false
  - note: |
       Sometimes when a child is born to two people before they get married, the court will require a separate case to establish paternity (even if everybody agrees).  However, most courts will move forward with just the divorce, assuming that paternity is acknowledged through the marriage.  For now, we'll move forward with the understanding that the paternity has been acknowledged.  However, a judge may direct you to file something else or speak to an attorney.

    js show if:   |
      val("minor_children_before_marriage") === true || val("minor_children_before_marriage") === false
  - note: |
      Missouri law automatically assumes that the husband is the father of the child unless a separate case is filed establishing paternity of the biological father and non-paternity of the husband, even if the biological father is the one on the birth certificate.  It would be in your best interest to find an attorney.

      Pursuant to RSMo 452.305 & 452.310, the court will not be able to grant a divorce.  Please come back when either yourself or your spouse is no longer pregnant.

question: Children Born Outside of Marriage
subquestion: |
  Missouri law automatically assumes that the husband is the father of the child unless a separate case is filed establishing paternity of the biological father and non-paternity of the husband, even if the biological father is the one on the birth certificate.  It would be in your best interest to find an attorney.

id: Children Born Before Marriage
question: Children Born Before Marriage
subquestion: |
  Sometimes when a child is born to two people before they get married, the court will require a separate case to establish paternity (even if everybody agrees).  However, most courts will move forward with just the divorce, assuming that paternity is acknowledged through the marriage.  For now, we'll move forward with the understanding that the paternity has been acknowledged.  However, a judge may direct you to file something else or speak to an attorney.
