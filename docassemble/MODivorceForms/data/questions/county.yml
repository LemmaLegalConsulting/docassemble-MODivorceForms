  Use Case.net to lookup your case

subquestion: |


  You can use [Case.net](https://www.courts.mo.gov/cnet)
  to help answer some questions on this website. You can find information like the hearing date and the case number online.

  Case.net is a free website from the Missouri Court. You do not need an
  account for Case.net.

  Using Case.net is optional, but it can help you answer the questions more
  accurately.
  
  To use Case.net to answer questions in this interview, you need to:

  1. Click the button below to open a search page on Case.net with your address
     and court name filled in.
  1. Find your case name in the search results and open it.

  You will need both this website and the Case.net website open at the same time. You will
  need to switch back and forth between the two windows.

  Look for your case in the search results. Click the link with the case number for your case to see the details about your case. If you do not see your case, try a different
  search.
